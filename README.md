# ruby-recursion
The Odin Project exercise in Ruby Programming to practice recursion. 

Includes an implementation of a fibonacci sequence function that takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence (iterative and recursive).

The **Fibonacci Sequence** is the series of numbers: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...` The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. 

Also includes an implementation of **merge sort**, a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm:
**Divide**: Split array down the middle into two subsequences, each of size roughly n/2.
**Conquer**: Sort each subsequence (by calling MergeSort recursively on each).
**Combine**: Merge the two sorted subsequences into a single sorted list.

(The dividing process ends when you have single item arrays).
